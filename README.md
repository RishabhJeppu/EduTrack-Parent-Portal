# EduTrack: Parent-Portal
This project is a clone of the parent portal of my college website.
It tracks the attendence percentage of each student in every subject and also the marks which they have got in each subject.
I used python language for the development of this project and also used Tkinter to design the front-end
MySql has been used as the database here
